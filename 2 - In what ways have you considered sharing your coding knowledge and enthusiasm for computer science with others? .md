I love this question! I’m a great believer in sharing my knowledge with others. I have three ways of paying forward, let me tell you in more detail!

### Writing Code Tutorials
A couple of years ago I started getting super excited to share what I knew with others, I started interning at a company where I was given permission to publish blog posts to a large audience of underrepresented students that were eager to learn to code. I wrote multiple tutorials on web and iOS development, as well as coding tips and tricks. Here is a link to all of the posts : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QEtajK2b5F0e-91xYfCdAe9MQCA4qt-mGikhO_Zp6SE/edit?usp=sharing

### Open Sourcing My Code and Projects
Another way in which I share my coding knowledge is through open sourcing my projects. I’m a developer, I come across coding problems all the time and always find a way to learn to solve the problem from an online solution because a fellow programmer from another place in the world has shared his or her code. I’m sure that many other developers come across the exact same issues as I have, so I pay it forward by sharing my code. Here is a link to my Github full of open source projects: https://github.com/kennybatista

### Attending Hackathons
One more way in which I share my coding knowledge is by going to hackathons and meeting up with other people that I can teach or learn from in order to build an application that can win us prizes. My team has won “Best Mobile App” at the biggest collegiate hackathon in the world at UCBerkley. Here is a link to the winning app in DevPost: https://devpost.com/software/travel-chest-pdye6a
