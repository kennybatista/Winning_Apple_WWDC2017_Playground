First off, thanks so much for the this great opportunity! I had lots of fun working on this playground, and learned about new technologies that I can use to show you guys what I can build and increase the visual appeal and meaningfulness of my personal applications! I’ll start off by going over what the main features on my playground represent, and then i’ll move forward and talk about the technologies I used to build them.

I wanted to build a playground that symbolized a main core value and notion from Apple that we all praise. Inclusion and Diversity. I used my programming skills to represent this belief through code that ignites graphics. There are three main features in my playground used to build upon this idea. My first feature illustrates a galaxy, which represents Apple’s limitless mission of growth. My second feature illustrates above-galaxy additions of colorful Apple’s in all sizes and shapes, which represents Apple’s diversity and inclusion. My third and last feature illustrates three colorful lines that wrap and lock around this visual belief and represents the constant drive in the mission by shining the first three primary colors of the the diversity flag. These three features come together in front of today’s modern Apple logo to represent how the core team at Apple ( entire company ) embraces people’s differences to grow as a whole.

The two main classes I used to build my playground’s visual interactivity were Apple’s CAEmitterLayer and UIBezierPath. CAEmitterLayer, which derives from the QuartzCore framework allowed me to render particles on top of the layer in my view. I used CAEmitterLayer to build two main features in my playground: 1) stars in galaxy particles, 2) flowing diversity Apple logos particles. UIBezierPath is a class deriving from the UIKit framework that allowed me to create line paths on top of my views. I used UIBezierPath to define the three straight colorful lines that angled around the flowing stars and colorful Apple logos.

Again, thank you so much for this opportunity, if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me!
